  "body": "### Overview\r\nIn 2015, a team of Columbia University graduate students designed this Open Data Toolkit as part of a consultancy on behalf of the School of International and Public Affairs and the East-West Management Institute. This toolkit was originally meant to guide and support open data initiatives by NGOs throughout the Mekong region. In 2016, we're launching the toolkit and making it available to the general public to both access and contribute. The goal of this Open Data Toolkit is to empower researchers and the general public to make better use of data.\r\n\r\n### Authors\r\nThe original toolkit was authored by [Lauren Barrett](@LaurenBa), [Nicole Hoesterey] (@nhoesterey17), [Mariana Quevedo Vallejo](@marianaquevedo), and [Junhe Yang](@lylawatching), with significant guidance, contributions, and expertise provided by [Sara-Jayne Terp](@bodacea). Together, we now work at ThoughtWorks, the World Bank, in international public diplomacy, and in field research in Zimbabwe.  \r\n\r\n### Contributions and Contact\r\nContact @LaurenBa. ",
